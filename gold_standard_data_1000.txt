Gold Standard Data
-------------------
The Gold Standard Data is a list of movie utterances and their annotated labels following Plutchik's primary emotions. The data is annotated by 5 independent annotators using multi-label scheme. The annotators are given the transcript and the corresponding video clips from the movie. The gold standard data is decided by the MAJORITY RULE: For one utterance, if one label is annotated at least 3 times, it is consider reliable and become a true label.

For more details of the data, please refer to the original submission.

VERSION INFORMATION
-------------------
Version 0.1 is the first version as of 10 May 2017 with the size of 1000 utterances. 

FORMAT
------
Each line has the following format:

[Character Name]:[Content of the utterance]#[Annotated labels]

8 labels are: Anger, Fear, Trust, Disgust, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, Anticipation. 

Because the data is annotated using multi-label scheme, we expect more than 1 label per utterance in some cases. There are also cases where the utterance is not annotated with any label, hence, the "None" annotation.

For example: 
cobb: that this world is not real.#Surprise,Fear,Sadness

zed: how'd you come to that conclusion?#Surprise,Disgust
james_edwards: well, first i was gonna pop this guy hanging from the street light, and i realized, y'know, he's just working out. i mean, how would i feel if somebody come runnin' in the gym and bust me in my ass while i'm on the treadmill? then i saw this snarling beast guy, and i noticed he had a tissue in his hand, and i'm realizing, y'know, he's not snarling, he's sneezing. y'know, ain't no real threat there. then i saw little tiffany. i'm thinking, y'know, eight-year-old white girl, middle of the ghetto, bunch of monsters, this time of night with quantum physics books? she about to start some shit, zed. she's about eight years old, those books are way too advanced for her. if you ask me, i'd say she's up to something. and to be honest, i'd appreciate it if you eased up off my back about it. pause or do i owe her an apology? pause that's a good shot though #Anticipation,Joy,Anger,Disgust

zed: you miserable little ingrates!#Anger,Disgust
kay: months, days, hours. always face it forward. explaining the neuralyzer to j #Anticipation
