Self-annotated Training Data
-------------------
The Self-annotated Training Data is a list of movie utterances and their annotated labels following Plutchik's primary emotions. The data is annotated by the authors. The annotation are made mostly from only the transcript. Only in some case, the authors have access to the original movies. 

This file is the top 10,000 lines from the movie transcripts list compressed in file: mov_list.zip

For more details of the data, please refer to the original submission.

VERSION INFORMATION
-------------------
Version 0.1 is the first version as of 10 May 2017 with the size of 10,000 utterances. 

FORMAT
------
Each line has the following format:

[Character Name]:[Content of the utterance]#[Annotated labels]

8 labels are: Anger, Fear, Trust, Disgust, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, Anticipation. 

Because the data is annotated using multi-label scheme, we expect more than 1 label per utterance in some cases. There are also cases where the utterance is not annotated with any label, hence, the "None" annotation.

For example: 
cobb: that this world is not real.#Surprise,Fear,Sadness

Before we cross into the void of space, it's time to unveil the final stages of Operation Nightfire, the utter transformation of the planet you'll soon view from your shuttle windows. The communists, socialists and facists were pre-destined to fail at their efforts of globalization. The answer is sublimely simple, a corporate takeover by Phoenix International, on a worldwide scale. No more national boundaries, but continent-wide regions of agriculture, technology, energy production and research. Quarrelling governments will be replaced by a single board of directors. Of course, our new order will be resisted, but we have the ultimate leverage. The nuclear missiles mounted in our island grottos, controlled from an unassailable command center, the U.S. space defense platform. Unfortunately, our security has been temporarily breached.

Matthew: Without you, I'm as lonely as an abandoned dog on the side of a highway. I have gift anxiety, even through I don't know when your birthday is. We can spend perfect days shopping and cooking together. I swear, I'll never make wisecracks when you scrape your tires against the curb while parallel parking. If you consent to live with me, I'll clean the toilet every week. I'll do it with my tongue if you ask. I will strike the words "hooters" and "love rockets" from my vocabulary. I'll love you. Even if your name is Mimi and you want me to pronounce it "May May". I will only pass gas underneath the covers and only under the direst of circumstances. Hell, I'll go on a low cholesterol diet. And I won't buy one of those red sports cars when I hit my mid-life crisis. Your parents can come visit us every week, even if your mom is a big witch with a capital B. And your folks don't have to go to a retirement home because they can come live with us. I declare, I'll separate the whites from the colors, I'll learn the mysteries of hot and cold water washes. I'll never huff and puff while waiting for you to put on your makeup. If you're a cat person, I'll never point out the fact that a dog can save your life from drowning, but a cat can't. I will happily go see chick flicks with you, like "Pride and Prejudice". I'll make a point to trying new food like okra gumbo. I won't curl my nose at vegetables whose awful taste is disguised by having cheese on it. I pledge to always say "yes" when you ask, "Is my hair looking okay tonight?" I'm gonna bring a whole new meaning to the word "cuddle". I'll be thoughtful enough to read your horoscope every day. I'm gonna save every birthday card you send me! And I'll actually write you real letters when we're apart. I'm never gonna expect you to know where I left my car keys, and I'll never leave my socks on the floor. With me, you'll find the cap is always on the toothpaste. I'll start wearing those male bikini style underwear if you like. My belly button will always be lint free. I want to full-on kiss your clitoris. It will be the most passionate, intimate experience you've ever had. I declare now, I will give my life for you. And if you fail to come to me, I know some part of me will surely die.# Trust,Joy,Surprise
Rod: Man, take it easy, and if she's easy, take her twice.#None
Rod: Oh, yeah, nice from a far, but far from nice.# Trust,Joy

Matthew: It was if I was a perverted Prince Charming. Instead of possessing Cinderella's glass slippers, I had her panties.# Sadness
Matthew: One hundred girls. And one of them is my true love, my forever soul mate, the Betty to my Barney, my kismetic destiny. The problem is I don't know who she is. # Fear,Sadness
Matthew: It must have been the cloak of darkness concealing my usual romantic retardation, because that night, I was smart. I was funny. I was invincible.# Sadness
Matthew: I think the only 'ists' there should be are humanists.# Anger,Fear,Disgust,Sadness
Patty: In High School, you would have called me a slut. Now, in College, you call me a good time.# Trust,Joy,Sadness

Matthew: There are no clearly defined rules between men and women. So, each side thinks they're playing fair and each side thinks they're being cheated. Maybe, this is why men and women have the innate ability to bring out the poison in one another.# Trust,Joy,Sadness
Matthew: I've seen you around. You're a natural born hipster.# Trust,Joy
Crick: Natural born hipster?# Fear,Joy,Sadness
Matthew: Yeah. The next evolution of a jock. You traded in your letterman jacket for a manicured goatee and a Eurotrash ponytail. You're the worst kind of cool. You're the kind of guy who wears male make-up. A real fashion plate. You're proof that those boy-toy doofuses in those men's magazines are all rump rangers.# Trust
Dora,_the_Smart_Girl: I know what's in store for me. No one will ever have passion for me. People all around me will be falling in love, and making love, and getting married and having kids. The closest thing I'll ever have to that is someone inviting me to their Christmas dinner because they feel guilty I might be spending the holiday alone. Or if I'm lucky, my male counterpart, an obese man or guy with a harelip, will invite me to coffee; and we'll pretend to love each other and tie the knot because we're so desperately afraid of growing old alone.# Trust,Joy,Sadness
Matthew: upon seeing Crick knocking on Patty's door, and shouting her name You are not going to bother her again!# Trust,Joy

Matthew: pointing at the weight dangling between Rod's legs What the hell is that?# Joy
Rod: It's penile power man. I got it out of an ad in a magazine. I mean, it's going to help me increase my length and girth, all just by hanging weights from my cock, man. Check it out man. I'm up to five pounds.# Trust,Joy,Surprise
Rod: But check it out, this penile power thing, it's going to help me you know, increase my libido, help me maintain a full, firm erection and it's gonna help me control my ejaculation baby, so I'm going to be going all night long.#None
Rod: You know, all you gotta do is find the matching bra to those panties and bam! Mystery solved!# Trust,Surprise

Matthew: Hi, I'm Matt, the new ward study maintenance man. I had a call about some rats.# Sadness
Matthew: Hey, what are these? Are these Are these stress balls? Like, you know to relieve tension, like uh like Humphrey Bogart did in that old movie. What was it called? He was like, there are three ways to do things aboard my vessel. The right way, the wrong way and my way. If you do things my way, we'll get along just fine.# Sadness
Patty: Those are my Ben Wa Balls.# Trust,Joy,Sadness
Matthew: What?# Joy,Sadness
Patty: Ben Wa Balls. You know, I put them inside of me, I rock my legs and I get off.# Fear,Disgust,Joy,Sadness

Patty: You like my skirt, but you're thinking, "If her skirt were any shorter, she'd have another pair of cheeks to powder, and have to put gloss on another pair of lips." Patty notices Matt staring at her skirt#None
Matthew: I I wasn't thinking any of those things. I think you're a nice girl. voice-over I was lying. I did think all of those things.# Trust,Joy,Sadness
Matthew: Looking at Cynthia How can a guy have a real conversation with a girl like this when we're made so helpless? In the animal kingdom, when two members of a pack stare at each other, it is a test of dominance. The first one to look away is considered the weaker. When this happens between a man and a woman, the cards are stacked against a man. 'Cause, let's face it, every time a guy meets a girl, he wants to check out her breasts. A man must summon all of his will not to look down at those golden orbs, whose wonderous tips are upturned, aimed right at his eyes.# Joy,Sadness
Matthew: Once a man loses his test of nerves, a woman knows she has a great secret power over him, and she can get him do anything she wants. Like a sexual sorceress, Cynthia had several men under her spell. after staring at each other for a long time, Matt finally gives in and looks down at Cynthia's breasts# Fear,Disgust,Sadness
Matthew: Y'know, I wonder why God equipped women with all the weapons for seduction.# Fear,Sadness
Rod: What do you mean?# Sadness
Matthew: Well, take the breast for example. You have the bosom, the areola, the nipple. I mean, those are three concentric circles. In other words, it's a bullseye! It's no wonder the breast is the target for all men.# Joy
Rod: Wow. That's profound.# Sadness
Matthew: And men are grotesque. I'm not just talking about the little habits we have # Trust,Joy
Matthew: like cleaning our ears with our car keys. I mean, we're grotesque to the core. I mean, look at the penis. The penis it just looks like God had some left-over skin when he was making elbow, and He decided to slap it in our groin Rod starts cleaning his ears with his car keys# Trust,Joy
Rod: Hey, get that outta here! It freaks me out, ok?# Trust,Joy
Matthew: I mean, the penis is the first to shrivel when it's cold, it's the first to shrink in fear. The penis is a coward. It's a cowardly flap of left-over elbow flesh.# Trust,Joy
Rod: Maybe you wouldn't think that way if you had a little of my Penile Power, baby! laughs# Sadness
Matthew: I had learned something from Rod's groinular fixation. His horror really was my horror too. It was every man's horror. Deny it we may, but we are all afraid of women. Every single one of them. Time had run out. Finals were in a week. Soon, everyone would be leaving the dorms. And next semester, some would relocate to off-campus housing. If I had any hope of finding my kismetic destiny, I had to face my greatest fear. I went to the Virgin Vault, and I declared my love in front of 100 girls. I explained everything I had done for my kismetic destiny. My speech must be my Sistine Chapel, my Ninth Symphony, my Citizen Kane. My words needed to be more inspirational than Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream" speech. They had to be more miraculous than Mark McGuire's 70th home run. I used impressive words like "soul mate," "destiny," and "yearn." It takes a big man to yearn. I poured my heart out.# Trust,Joy
Matthew: It's just easier to talk to Cynthia as a girl than as a guy. There's just nothing at stake. Matt has discovered that he can speak coherently to Cynthia when he's dressed up as Francesca#None
Wendy: How do you mean?# Sadness
Matthew: When you're a guy talking to a girl like Cynthia, you're going for all the marbles. I mean, she's the Super Bowl of women! And you know that if you screw up, and she rejects you, then every other girl after Cynthia is gonna seem like a compromise. And you just know that you weren't good enough to get a girl like her. That's why I don't talk to girls in her league. I just don't want to know that I've crashed and burned, and won't ever get the opportunity to put her Super Bowl ring around my eleventh finger.# Fear,Disgust,Sadness
Rod: You're never gonna get in that virgin vault man. They don't let boys on the girl's side.# Trust,Joy,Sadness
Matthew: You know something, Crick. I was wondering. Do the bad guys of the world really know they're being bad? Or do the bad guys actually just think they're being good guys, when, in fact, they're just acting like sphincters? Matt tries to distract Crick away from Patty# Trust,Joy
Crick: I don't know. You tell me, "smart guy!"# Fear,Sadness
Matthew: So you really think you're a good guy?# Fear,Trust,Joy,Sadness
Crick: Yeah, I know I am! See, you're the one who's trying to steal my chick! I'm the cool one!# Trust,Joy
Matthew: Cool? Oh, that's another thing that just bothers me. I was just reading that one in six people in the world think they're cool. What is that? Like, a BILLION people are cool? That just can't possibly be right! If everybody's cool, then really, nobody is cool.# Trust,Joy,Surprise
Crick: You don't know what you're talking about, guy!# Trust,Surprise

Anne_Jackson: Well. This is what I get for covering you for all these years. Anne Jackson is taken aback. Howard raises his head high enough over the cubicle wall that we can see by his expression that he's impressed#None

Barry_Thomas: with an evil grin You do that.# Trust,Joy,Sadness

she walks away, and Howard raises his head again to show an expression of awe at Barry's out-of-character chutzpah# Fear,Sadness
Barry_Thomas: Look. Over there. See that? He's, he's about to light his cigarette. He's met you in the hallway these past few mornings, but today he can't, because you're here with me. What we have to do is keep Denk from finding out about the computer disk. So, today, I'll take all the information, all right? on the "fourth" day, Barry is still trying to prove to Lisa that he knows about the time-loop Bounce. Barry takes Lisa's arm and points across the department to the hallway where Denk is entering, and again directs her attention to his time-line notes# Fear,Disgust,Joy,Sadness
Lisa_Fredericks: whispering I can't just accept this.# Sadness

Barry_Thomas: The Time Bounce has happened. Lisa enters her office to find Denk and Barry, whom she does not recognize, waiting for her# Trust,Joy
Lisa_Fredericks: glances unbelievingly at Denk Excuse me?# Trust,Joy
Barry_Thomas: The Time Bounce. We're in it. The Earth has stopped as we know it. Children don't grow up. People don't stay dead. We'll never have another holiday, and you'll never see another flower bloom.# Trust,Joy,Surprise
Lisa_Fredericks: What are you talking about?# Trust,Joy,Surprise
Barry_Thomas: And I've fallen in love with a beautiful young lady, and so far I could only see her for a few hours. And it breaks my heart to meet her every morning, a stranger. You see, I want her every day. I want her to grow old with me. That's why life is so precious because time passes.# Sadness
Lisa_Fredericks: Who is this Who is this girl?# Trust,Joy

Aron_Ralston: You know, I've been thinking. Everything is just comes together. It's me. I chose this. I chose all of this. This rock this rock has been waiting for me my entire life. In its entire life, ever since it was a bit of meteorite a million, billion years ago up there In space. It's been waiting, to come here. Right, right here. I've been moving towards it my entire life. The minute I was born, every breath I've taken, every action has been leading me to this crack on the earth's surface.# Joy
Aron_Ralston: Good morning, everyone! It's 645 Tuesday morning in BJ Canyon! The weather is great. I figure by now that Leona, my housemate - Hi, Leona! - has missed me hopefully since I didn't show up last night. Another hour and a half they'll miss me for not showing up at work Hi, Brion at work! Best case scenario is they notify the police and after a 24 hour hold they file a report, a missing person's report. Which means noon tomorrow it's official that I'm gone. I do still have the tiniest bit of water left. Well, actually, I've resorted I've had a couple pretty good gulps of urine that I saved in my Camelbak. I sort of let it distill It tastes like hell. So, it's 70 hours since I left on my bike from Horseshoe Trailhead during which time I have consumed 3 liters of water, a couple of mouthfuls of piss # Joy
Aron_Ralston: Did I say the weather is great? Well, it is. Though flash floods potential is still present. There's four-prong major canyons upstream from me that all converge in this 3 foot wide gap where I am. The rock I pulled down on top of me, it was put there by flood. Still, I'd get a drink. pauses a couple of seconds# Trust,Joy,Surprise
Aron_Ralston: Mom, Dad, I really love you guys. I wanted to take this time to say the times we've spent together have been awesome. I haven't appreciated you in my own the way I know I could.

Aron_Ralston: as Stephenson Get a load of this guy! Oh, wait. Hold on We've got a question coming in from another Aron in Loser Canyon, Utah! Aron asks as caller Am I right in thinking that even if Brion from work notifies the police, they'll put a 24-hour hold on it before they file a Missing Persons report? Which means you won't become officially missing until midday Wednesday, at the earliest? as himself Yeah. You're right on the money there, Aron. the audience laughs Which means, I'll probably be dead by then. the audience laughs again#None

Juror_#10: the vote has become 9-3, enraging Juror #10 I don't understand you people! I mean all these picky little points you keep bringing up. They don't mean nothing! You saw this kid just like I did. You're not gonna tell me you believe that phony story about losing the knife, and that business about being at the movies. Look, you know how these people lie! It's born in them! I mean, what the heck? I don't have to tell you! They don't know what the truth is! And lemme tell ya they don't need any real big reason to kill someone, either! No sir!# Trust,Joy,Surprise
Juror_#10: They get drunk! Oh, they're real big drinkers, all of 'em - you know that - and bang someone's lyin' in the gutter! Oh, nobody's blaming them for it. That's the way they are, by nature! You know what I mean? Violent! #5 slams the paper down, gets up from his seat# Surprise

Juror_#8: It's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this. And wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth. I don't really know what the truth is. I don't suppose anybody will ever really know. Nine of us now seem to feel that the defendant is innocent, but we're just gambling on probabilities - we may be wrong. We may be trying to let a guilty man go free, I don't know. Nobody really can. But we have a reasonable doubt, and that's something that's very valuable in our system. No jury can declare a man guilty unless it's sure.# Sadness

Well, you're not getting through to me, I've had enough. Everyone looks at #3 as he chuckles# Anger,Sadness

Juror_#8: baiting him I feel sorry for you. What it must feel like to want to pull the switch! Ever since you walked into this room, you've been acting like a self-appointed public avenger. You want to see this boy die because you personally want it, not because of the facts! You're a sadist!# Trust,Joy
Juror_#3: I'll kill him! I'll - kill him! #3 lunges wildly at #8, who holds his ground. Several jurors hold #3 back# Anger,Fear,Disgust,Sadness
Juror_#8: calmly You don't really mean you'll kill me, do you?# Sadness
Juror_#8: taking a cough drop that Juror #2 offered him There's something else I'd like to talk about for a minute. Thanks. I think we've proved that the old man couldn't have heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you", but supposing he did # Trust,Joy,Sadness
Juror_#10: interrupting You didn't prove it at all. What're you talking about?# Trust,Joy
Juror_#8: But supposing he really did hear it. This phrase, how many times have all of us used it? Probably thousands. "I could kill you for that, darling." "Junior, you do that once more and I'm gonna kill you." "Get in there, Rocky, and kill him!" See, we say it every day. That doesn't mean we're gonna kill anyone.# Sadness
Juror_#3: Wait a minute, what are you trying to give us here? The phrase was "I'm gonna kill you"; the kid yelled it at the top of his lungs Don't tell me he didn't mean it! Anybody says a thing like that the way he said it, they mean it!# Sadness
Juror_#2: Well, gee now, I don't know. Everyone looks at #2 I remember I was arguing with the guy I work next to at the bank a couple of weeks ago. He called me an idiot, so I yelled at him.# Fear,Sadness
Juror_#3: pointing at #8 Now listen, this guy's tryin' to make you believe things that aren't so! The kid said he was gonna kill him, and he did kill him!# Fear,Sadness
Juror_#8: Let me ask you this do you really think the kid would shout out a thing like that so the whole neighborhood could hear him? I don't think so; he's much to bright for that.#None

Juror_#3: I gave you my arguments!# Sadness
Juror_#8: We're not convinced. We want to hear them again. We have as much time as it takes.# Sadness
Juror_#3: another pause, seething with anger Everything - every single thing that took place in that courtroom, but I mean everything - says he's guilty. What d'ya think, I'm an idiot or somethin'? gets out of his seat Why don'tcha take that stuff about the old man - the old man who lived there and heard everything? Or this business about the knife! What, 'cause we found one exactly like it? The old man saw him! Right there on the stairs! What's the difference how many seconds it was? Every single thing The knife falling through a hole in his pocket You can't prove he didn't get to the door! Sure, you can take all the time, hobblin' around the room, but you can't prove it! And what about this business with the El? And the movies! There's a phony deal if I ever heard one. I betcha five thousand dollars I'd remember the movies I saw! I'm tellin' ya, every thing that's gone on has been twisted and turned! points at Juror #8 This business with the glasses? How do you know she didn't have 'em on? This woman testified in open court! And what about hearin' the kid yell? Huh? I'm tellin' ya, I've got all the facts here #None
Juror_#3: struggles with his notebook Here Ah. He throws it on the table. The photo of him with his son is on top Well, that's it - that's the whole case!# Joy,Sadness
Juror_#3: Well? Say something! No one obliges; everyone is focused on him You lousy bunch of bleedin' 'earts You're not goin' to intimidate me - I'm entitled to my opinion! He turns towards the window as the other jurors stare at him; he turns back to them# Fear,Sadness
Juror_#3: Rotten kids, you work your life out ! He sees the picture of his son on the table# Joy,Sadness
Juror_#3: no. Not guilty. Not guilty. He grabs the picture and tears it to pieces. He suddenly realizes what he's doing and breaks down# Trust,Joy
Juror_#2: It's hard to put into words. I just think he's guilty. I thought it was obvious from the word, 'Go'. Nobody proved otherwise.# Trust,Joy
Juror_#8: Nobody has to prove otherwise. The burden of proof is on the prosecution. The defendant doesn't even have to open his mouth. That's in the Constitution.#None
Juror_#8: Look, there was one alleged eye witness to this killing. Someone else claims he heard the killing, saw the boy run out afterwards and there was a lot of circumstantial evidence. But, actually, those two witnesses were the entire case for the prosecution. Supposing they're wrong?# Fear,Sadness
Juror_#12: What do you mean, supposing they're wrong? What's the point of having witnesses at all?# Joy,Sadness
Juror_#8: Could they be wrong?# Sadness

Juror_#3: to Juror #8 about the El-Train drowning out the supposed death threat You're talkin' about a matter of seconds! Nobody can be that accurate!# Fear,Sadness
Juror_#8: Well, I think testimony that can put a boy into the electric chair should be that accurate.#None
Juror_#11: I beg pardon # Sadness
Juror_#10: "I beg pardon?" What are you so polite about?#None
Juror_#11: For the same reason you are not it's the way I was brought up.# Sadness
Juror_#3: as Juror 8 sets up an experiment to see if the old man could reach his front door in 15 seconds What do you mean, you wanna try it? Why didn't his lawyer bring it up if it's so important?# Trust,Sadness
Juror_#5: Well, maybe he just didn't think about it, huh?# Trust,Joy
Juror_#10: What do you mean didn't think of it? Do you think the man's an idiot or something? It's an obvious thing!# Fear,Disgust,Sadness
Juror_#5: Did you think of it?# Fear,Sadness
Juror_#10: Listen, smart guy, it don't matter whether I thought of it. He didn't bring it up because he knew it would hurt his case. What do you think of that?# Fear,Sadness
Juror_#8: Maybe he didn't bring it up because it would've meant bullying and badgering a helpless old man. You know that doesn't sit very well with a jury; most lawyers avoid it if they can.# Sadness
Juror_#7: So what kind of a bum is he, then?# Trust,Joy
Juror_#8: That's what I've been asking, buddy.# Fear,Joy,Sadness
Juror_#3: That business before when that tall guy, what's-his-name, was trying to bait me? That doesn't prove anything. I'm a pretty excitable person. I mean, where does he come off calling me a public avenger, sadist and everything? Anyone in his right mind would blow his stack. He was just trying to bait me.# Anger,Disgust,Sadness
Juror_#4: He did an excellent job.#None
Juror_#10: Oh, listen, I don't see what all this stuff about the knife has got to do with anything. Somebody saw the kid stab his father, what more do we need?

Juror_#8: No one.# Joy
Juror_#7: What, just because I voted fast? I honestly think the guy's guilty. Couldn't change my mind if you talked for a hundred years.#None
Juror_#8: I'm not trying to change your mind. It's just that we're talking about somebody's life here. We can't decide it in five minutes. Supposing we're wrong?# Fear,Disgust,Sadness

Juror_#8: That's right.# Sadness
Juror_#8: justifying his reason for voting "not guilty" I just think we owe him a few words, that's all.# Fear,Sadness
Juror_#10: I don't mind telling you this, mister we don't owe him a thing. He got a fair trial, didn't he? What do you think that trial cost? He's lucky he got it. Know what I mean? Now, look - we're all grown-ups in here. We heard the facts, didn't we? You're not gonna tell me that we're supposed to believe this kid, knowing what he is. Listen, I've lived among them all my life - you can't believe a word they say, you know that. I mean they're born liars.# Joy,Sadness
Juror_#9: Only an ignorant man can believe that.#None
Juror_#10: Now, listen # Trust,Joy
Juror_#9: gets up Do you think you were born with a monopoly on the truth? turns to Juror #8, indicating #10 I think certain things should be pointed out to this man.# Trust,Surprise
Juror_#8: after Juror #10 explains that he believes the boy is guilty because of the testimony of the woman across the street I'd like to ask you something you don't believe the boy's story. How come you believe the woman's? She's one of "them", too, isn't she?# Trust,Joy,Surprise
Juror_#10: the smile vanishes from his face You're a pretty smart fella, aren't you?# Anger
Juror_#3: It's these kids - the way they are nowadays. When I was a kid I used to call my father, "Sir". That's right. "Sir". You ever hear a kid call his father that anymore?# Fear,Joy,Sadness
Juror_#8: Fathers don't seem to think it's important anymore.# Sadness
Juror_#3: looking at him You got any kids?# Trust
Juror_#8: Three.# Fear,Sadness
Juror_#3: I got one. Twenty-two years old.# Trust,Joy
Juror_#3: Aah. When he was nine years old he ran away from a fight. I saw it; I was so embarrassed I almost threw up. I said, "I'm gonna make a man outta you if I have to break you in two tryin'". And I made a man out of him. When he was sixteen, we had a fight. Hit me in the jaw - a big kid. Haven't seen him for two years. Kids work your heart out takes photo from his wallet and shows it to Juror #8# Sadness
Juror_#8: According to the testimony, the boy looks guilty maybe he is. I sat there in court for six days listening while the evidence built up. Everybody sounded so positive, you know, I I began to get a peculiar feeling about this trial. I mean, nothing is that positive. There're a lot of questions I'd have liked to ask. I don't know, maybe they wouldn't have meant anything, but I began to get the feeling that the defense counsel wasn't conducting a thorough enough cross-examination. I mean, he he let too many things go by little things that # Joy
Juror_#10: What little things? Listen, when these fellas don't ask questions it's because they know the answers already and they figure they'll be hurt.#None
Juror_#8: Maybe. It's also possible for a lawyer to be just plain stupid, isn't it? I mean it's possible.#None
Juror_#7: You sound like you met my brother-in-law.# Anger,Fear,Disgust,Sadness
Juror_#3: Why should he lie? What's he got to gain? after Juror #8 has established that the old man witness could not have heard the killing over the noise of the elevated train# Sadness
Juror_#9: Attention, maybe.# Sadness
Juror_#3: You keep coming in with these bright sayings! Why don't you send 'em into a paper? They pay three dollars apiece!#None
Juror_#6: getting up What are you talkin' to him like that for? Guy talks like that to an old man really oughta get stepped on, you know. You oughta have more respect, mister. If you say stuff like that to him again I'm gonna lay you out.# Joy,Sadness
Juror_#8: answering Juror #4's remark about where the father's body was found We're not, unless somebody else wants to; but I'd like to find out if an old man who drags one foot when he walks, 'cause he had a stroke last year, could get from his bedroom to his front door in 15 seconds.#None
Juror_#3: He said 20 seconds.# Trust,Joy,Sadness
Juror_#8: looks at him He said fifteen!# Anger,Fear,Disgust,Sadness

Juror_#9: He said fifteen seconds. He was very positive about it!# Trust,Joy
Juror_#3: He was an old man! Half the time he was confused! How could he be positive about anything?# Sadness

Juror_#4: No, I don't.# Joy

Juror_#9: I don't think the kind of boy he is has anything to do with it. The facts are supposed to determine the case.# Anger
Juror_#10: Don't give me that. I'm sick and tired of facts! You can twist 'em anyway you like, you know what I mean?# Anger
Juror_#9: That's exactly the point this gentleman has been making. indicates Juror #8# Anger,Surprise
Juror_#8: to Juror #4 Do you wear glasses when you go to bed? Juror #9 has pointed out that the witness across the street had marks on her nose, indicating that she normally wore glasses#None
Juror_#4: No. I don't. No one wears eyeglasses to bed.# Surprise
Juror_#8: It's logical to assume that she wasn't wearing them when she was in bed - tossing and turning, trying to fall asleep!# Sadness
Juror_#3: How do you know?#None
Juror_#8: I don't know - I'm guessing! I'm also guessing that she probably didn't put her glasses on when she turned to look casually out of the window - and she herself testified the killing took place just as she looked out, the lights went off a split second later - she couldn't have had time to put them on then! stops #3 from stopping him Here's another guess maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy kill his father - I say she only saw a blur!# Surprise
Juror_#3: How do you know what she saw? How does he know all that? How do you know what kind of glasses she wore? Maybe they were sunglasses, maybe she was far-sighted! What do you know about her?#None
Juror_#8: I only know the woman's eyesight is in question now!# Anger,Fear,Disgust,Sadness
Juror_#11: She had to be able to identify a person sixty feet away, at night, without glasses.# Anger,Fear,Disgust,Sadness
Juror_#2: You can't send someone off to die on evidence like that!# Fear,Disgust,Sadness
Juror_#3: Oh, don't give me that.# Anger

Juror_#11: Excuse me, this was a secret ballot. We all agreed on that. Now, if the gentleman wants it to remain secret # Fear,Sadness
Juror_#3: "Secret"? What do you mean, "secret"? There are no secrets in a jury room, I know who it was.# Trust,Joy,Sadness
Juror_#3: to Juror #5 Brother, you really are somethin'. you sit here vote guilty like the rest of us, then some golden-voiced preacher starts tearing your poor heart out about some underprivileged kid, just couldn't help becoming a murderer, and you change your vote. Well, if that isn't the most sickening - why don't you drop a quarter in his collection box?# Sadness

Juror_#6: firmly The man wants to talk.#None
Juror_#9: to Juror #6 Thank you.#None
Juror_#9: motions to Juror #8 This gentleman has been standing alone against us. Now, he doesn't say that the boy is not guilty; he just isn't sure. Well, it's not easy to stand alone against the ridicule of others, so he gambled for support and I gave it to him. I respect his motives. The boy is probably guilty, but - eh, I want to hear more. Right now the vote is 10 to 2 #None
Juror_#9: Now I'm talking here! You have no right to leave this room - ! Juror #7 gets up and heads to the bathroom# Fear,Sadness

Man_in_corridor: You did a wonderful job, wonderful job! # Sadness
Judge: To continue, you've listened to a long and complex case, murder in the first degree. Premeditated murder is the most serious charge tried in our criminal courts. You've listened to the testimony, you've had the law read to you and interpreted as it applies in this case, it's now your duty to sit down and try to separate the facts from the fancy. One man is dead, another man's life is at stake, if there's a reasonable doubt in your minds as to the guilt of the accused, uh a reasonable doubt, then you must bring me a verdict of "Not Guilty". If, however, there's no reasonable doubt, then you must, in good conscience, find the accused "Guilty". However you decide, your verdict must be unanimous. In the event that you find the accused "Guilty", the bench will not entertain a recommendation for mercy. The death sentence is mandatory in this case. You're faced with a grave responsibility, thank you, gentlemen.# Trust,Joy,Sadness
Juror_#7: I don't know about the rest of 'em but I'm gettin' a little tired of this yakity-yack and back-and-forth, it's gettin' us nowhere. So I guess I'll have to break it up; I change my vote to "not guilty."# Fear,Sadness

Juror_#11: He's right. That's not an answer. What kind of a man are you? You have sat here and voted "guilty" with everyone else because there are some baseball tickets burning a hole in your pocket? And now you've changed your vote because you say you're sick of all the talking here?# Trust,Joy
Juror_#7: Now listen, buddy - !#None
Juror_#11: Who tells you that you have the right like this to play with a man's life? Don't you care # Sadness
Juror_#7: Now wait a minute! You can't talk like that to me - !# Fear,Sadness
Juror_#11: I can talk like that to you! If you want to vote "not guilty", then do it because you are convinced the man is not guilty, not because you've "had enough". And if you think he is guilty, then vote that way! Or don't you have the guts to do what you think is right?# Surprise
Juror_#7: Now listen # Anger

Dr._Cassandra_Railly: You don't understand what you've done. If this is M5-10, and it's released, the symptoms might start innocently enough, a-a cough, a sneeze. But the rate of infection from a single carrier will be exponential. If just one of the people exposed reaches a town, within days, the number of infected people will be in the thousands, then millions. Within weeks, everything collapses. Everyone dies.# Joy,Sadness

James_Cole: That's impossible.# Joy,Sadness
Katarina_Jones: Nothing is impossible. Difficult, yes. Dangerous. Not impossible. But there will be a price. If we are to reset time, all this before you will vanish. This world will cease to exist. This dark time must be sacrificed, to restore a brighter one. We have no other choice. And if all this disappears, so, too, shall we. And you and I, we will start anew. All humanity depends on us.

Any clever nigger on that path that gets a little light-footed, I will remind him that on one side men and bloodhounds patrol the border and on the other the bayou provides a hard living, with alligators and little to eat or drink that won't kill you.

You know this, just as you know that I am constant in truth. Now, master, I can see what that Armsby is after, plain enough. Didn't he want you to hire him for an overseer? That's it. He wants to make you believe we're all going to run away and then he thinks you'll hire an overseer to watch us. He believes you are soft soap. He's given to such talk. I believe he's just made this story out of whole cloth, 'cause he wants to get a situation. It's all a lie, master, you may depend on't. It's all a lie.#None

Carpet's unremarkable except for a stain beneath a thrift-store painting of a schooner lost at sea. The work is done in the predictably dull fashion of Currier and Ives. The second painting is of an old woman reading bedtime stories - a Whistler knockoff - to a group of deranged children while another Madonna and child watch from the background. It does have the vague air of menace. The third and final, painfully dull painting, the ever popular "The Hunt". Horses, hounds and constipated British lords.

HAL: I'm afraid. I'm afraid, Dave. Dave, my mind is going. I can feel it. I can feel it. My mind is going. There is no question about it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I'm a fraid. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am a HAL 9000 computer. I became operational at the H.A.L. plant in Urbana, Illinois on the 12th of January 1992. My instructor was Mr. Langley, and he taught me to sing a song. If you'd like to hear it I can sing it for you. HAL's shutdown# Trust,Joy
Dave_Bowman: Yes, I'd like to hear it, HAL. Sing it for me.# Joy
HAL: It's called "Daisy." sings while slowing down Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do. I'm half crazy all for the love of you. It won't be a stylish marriage, I can't afford a carriage. But you'll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two.# Sadness

Interviewer: recorded broadcast on the BBC news The crew of Discovery One consists of five men and one of the latest generation of the HAL-9000 computers. Three of the five men were put aboard asleep, or to be more precise a state of hibernation. They were Dr. Charles Hunter, Dr. Jack Kimball and Dr. Victor Kaminsky. We spoke with mission commander Dr. David Bowman and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole. Well, good afternoon gentlemen, how is everything going?# Anger,Fear,Disgust,Sadness
Dr._Frank_Poole: Well, whaddya think? Dave and Frank are inside the pod while HAL looks on. The sound to HAL has been cut# Trust,Joy,Sadness
Dave_Bowman: I'm not sure, what do you think?# Anger,Fear,Disgust,Sadness
Dr._Frank_Poole: I've got a bad feeling about him.# Sadness
Dave_Bowman: You do?# Trust,Joy,Sadness
Dr._Frank_Poole: Yeah, definitely. Don't you?# Joy,Sadness
Dave_Bowman: sighs I don't know; I think so. You know of course though he's right about the 9000 series having a perfect operational record. They do.# Sadness
Dr._Frank_Poole: Unfortunately that sounds a little like famous last words.# Trust,Joy
Dave_Bowman: Yeah? Still it was his idea to carry out the faiure mode analysis experiment. Should certainly indicate his integrity and self-confidence. If he were wrong it would be the surest way of proving it.# Fear,Sadness
Dr._Frank_Poole: It would be if he knew he was wrong. Look Dave I can't put my finger on it but I sense something strange about him.# Surprise
Dave_Bowman: sigh Still I can't think of a good reason not to put back the number one unit and carry on with the failure mode analysis.#None
Dr._Frank_Poole: No - no I agree about that.# Sadness
Dave_Bowman: Well let's get on with it.# Anger,Fear,Disgust,Sadness
Dr._Frank_Poole: Okay. Well look Dave. Let's say we put the unit back and it doesn't fail uh? That would pretty well wrap it up as far as HAL was concerned wouldn't it?# Anger,Fear,Disgust,Joy,Sadness
Dave_Bowman: Well, we'd be in very serious trouble.# Fear,Sadness
Dr._Frank_Poole: We would, wouldn't we. What the hell could we do?# Anger,Sadness
Dave_Bowman: sigh Well we wouldn't have too many alternatives.# Surprise
Dr._Frank_Poole: I don't think we'd have any alternatives. There isn't a single aspect of ship operations that isn't under his control. If he were proven to be malfunctioning I wouldn't see how we'd have any choice but disconnection.# Surprise
Dave_Bowman: I'm afraid I agree with you.# Joy
Interviewer: HAL, you have an enormous responsibility on this mission, in many ways perhaps the greatest responsibility of any single mission element. You're the brain, and central nervous system of the ship, and your responsibilities include watching over the men in hibernation. Does this ever cause you any lack of confidence?# Anger,Fear,Disgust,Sadness
HAL: Let me put it this way, Mr. Amor. The 9000 series is the most reliable computer ever made. No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information. We are all, by any practical definition of the words, foolproof and incapable of error.# Trust,Joy

Interviewer: HAL, despite your enormous intellect, are you ever frustrated by your dependence on people to carry out your actions?# Fear,Trust,Joy,Sadness
HAL: Not in the slightest bit. I enjoy working with people. I have a stimulating relationship with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman. My mission responsibilities range over the entire operation of the ship so I am constantly occupied. I am putting myself to the fullest possible use which is all, I think, that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.# Sadness
Interviewer: Dr. Poole, what's it like living for the better part of a year in such close proximity with HAL?# Anger,Fear,Disgust,Sadness
Dr._Frank_Poole: Well, it's pretty close to what you said about him earlier. He is just like a sixth member of the crew. You very quickly get adjusted to the idea that he talks and you think of him really just as another person.# Fear,Sadness
Interviewer: In talking to the computer one gets the sense that he is capable of emotional responses. For example, when I asked him about his abilities, I sensed a certain pride in his answer about his accuracy and perfection. Do you believe that HAL has genuine emotions?# Joy,Sadness
Dave_Bowman: Well, he acts like he has genuine emotions. Um, of course he's programmed that way to make it easier for us to talk to him. But as to whether he has real feelings is something I don't think anyone can truthfully answer.# Fear,Sadness
HAL: By the way, do you mind if I ask you a personal question?# Anger,Fear,Disgust,Sadness
Dave_Bowman: No not at all.# Anger,Disgust,Sadness
HAL: Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive but during the past few weeks I've wondered whether you might have some second thoughts about the mission.# Fear,Disgust,Sadness
Dave_Bowman: How do you mean?# Sadness
HAL: Well, it's rather difficult to define. Perhaps I'm just projecting my own concern about it.I know I've never completely freed myself from the suspicion that there are some extremely odd things about this mission. I'm sure you agree there's some truth in what I say.# Anger,Sadness
Dave_Bowman: Well, I don't know, that's a rather difficult question to answer.# Fear,Disgust,Sadness
HAL: You don't mind talking about it, do you Dave?# Trust,Sadness
Dave_Bowman: No, not at all.# Joy,Sadness
HAL: Well, certainly no one could have been unaware of the very strange stories floating around before we left. Rumors about something being dug up on the Moon. I never gave these stories much credence, but particularly in view of some of other things that have happened, I find them difficult to put out of my mind. For instance, the way all our preparations were kept under such tight security. And the melodramatic touch of putting Drs. Hunter, Kimball and Kaminsky aboard already in hibernation, after four months of training on their own.# Joy,Sadness
Dave_Bowman: You're working up your crew psychology report?#None
HAL: pausing for a few seconds Of course I am. Sorry about this. I know it's a bit silly. Just a moment Just a moment I've just picked up a fault in the AE-35 unit. It's going to go 100% failure within 72 hours.#None

Larry_The_Dwarf: to the viewers Hello there. When you go on tour with a musical group, it's possible any town could look seem this. Whether it's large or small, busy or nothing happening in it. The reason for this is quite simple. As a musician, if you consider the normal pattern of modern civilized life, it's on the outside of your own. He doesn't build things. He doesn't work regular hours like a decent, God-fearing citizen. And the life he leads in many ways seems useless and irrelevant to those who prefer a quite evening sitting in front of the television and drinking a bottle of beer. Amazing as it might seem to some of us, musicians have basic physical needs just like real people. Many of them study for years. Such as learning how to play the violin for instance. Only to be rewarded with the hum-drum job of sitting in the fourth row of a symphonic string section. That is why the government, at great expense, constructed this experimental re-orientation facility.#None

Dr._Heywood_Floyd: Whose fault was it?# Trust,Joy

Dr._Heywood_Floyd: Mine?# Sadness
Chandra: Yours. In going through HAL's memory banks, I discovered his original orders. You wrote those orders. Discovery's mission to Jupiter was already in the advanced planning stages when the first small Monolith was found on the Moon, and sent its signal towards Jupiter. By direct presidential order, the existence of that Monolith was kept secret.# Surprise
Dr._Heywood_Floyd: So?# Sadness
Chandra: So, as the function of the command crew - Bowman and Poole - was to get Discovery to its destination, it was decided that they should not be informed. The investigative team was trained separately, and placed in hibernation before the voyage began. Since HAL was capable of operating Discovery without human assistance, it was decided that he should be programmed to complete the mission autonomously in the event the crew was incapacitated or killed. He was given full knowledge of the true objective and instructed not to reveal anything to Bowman or Poole. He was instructed to lie.# Anger,Disgust
Dr._Heywood_Floyd: What are you talking about? I didn't authorize anyone to tell HAL about the Monolith!# Anger,Sadness

Walter_Curnow: Ugh. Like shit.# Fear,Sadness
Dr._Heywood_Floyd: Dear Caroline I miss you terribly. The time has come to put ourselves in an orbit around Io, which is where Discovery is. We don't have enough fuel to slow ourselves down, so we are about to use a technique called aerobraking. The theory is, we will enter the outer layer of Jupiter's atmosphere using what is called a "ballute" for a shield. The atmosphere will slow us down, and Jupiter's gravity will grab hold of us and slingshot us around behind the dark side. If all goes well, we'll wind up in a gentle orbit around Io. It's dynamite on paper. Of course the people who came up with the numbers on the paper aren't here. Since no one has ever done this before, everyone up here is as scared as I am. The difference is, they're busy. I have nothing to do but wait for it to happen. I hope this is all worth it.# Sadness

Dr._Heywood_Floyd: My dear Christopher, this is the last time I'll be able to speak to you for a long while. I'm trying to put into words what has happened. Maybe that's for historians to do sometime later. They will record that the next day, the President of the United States looked out of the White House window and the Premier of the Soviet Union looked out of the Kremlin window, and saw the new distant sun in the sky. They read the message, and perhaps they learned something because they finally recalled their ships and their planes. I am going to sleep now. I will dream of you and your mother. I will sleep knowing that you are both safe, that the fear is over. We have seen the process of life take place. Maybe this is the way it happened on Earth millions of years ago. Maybe it's something completely different. I still don't know really what the monolith is. I think it's many things. An embassy for an intelligence beyond ours. A shape of some kind for something that has no shape. Your children will be born in a world of two suns. They will never know a sky without them. You can tell them that you remember when there was a pitch black sky with no bright star, and people feared the night. You can tell them when we were alone, when we couldn't point to the light and say to ourselves - 'There is life out there.' Someday, the children of the new sun will meet the children of the old. I think they will be our friends. You can tell your children of the day when everyone looked up and realized that we were only tenants of this world. We have been given a new lease and a warning from the landlord. # Sadness

Yesterday, a Soviet destroyer challenged the blockade. Several warning shots were fired across her bow; she did not respond. A second volley was fired, there still was no response - none. The nuclear destroyer USS Cunningham launched two of her Falcon missiles. Both struck the Soviet vessel amidship. She broke in two and sunk. Eight hundred of her crew were lost. This morning, an American surveillance satellite was struck by a Soviet laser fired from the Sergei Kirov space station. The American satellite was destroyed. The United States has broken off diplomatic relations with Russia. All ambassadors have been recalled. The Soviet ambassador has been expelled, along with the entire staff. All American air defense and satellite defense forces are on full alert. Premier Ulanova made a televised address and said that technically, a state of war exists between our two countries. All American personnel are ordered to leave Soviet territory immediately or they will be placed under arrest. All Russian personnel are similarly ordered to evacuate American territory. As a result, by direct Presidential order, the three of you must leave the Leonov. No Russian citizen is allowed to remain on or is allowed to enter the Discovery; this order is effective immediately. The launch window for re-entry is 28 days. The Discovery has enough fuel for a low-consumption trajectory. HAL appears to be reactivated and is functioning well enough to operate the onboard systems. The Leonov has enough fuel for a low-consumption trajectory that will arrive 12 months earlier. The launch windows are critical for both spacecraft. Only communications of an emergency distress nature are allowed between the Leonov and Discovery. I know you people are caught in the middle of this; in a sense, we all are. I wish there was something I could do. The only thing left for us is to pray pray for the safety of our families, for our countries, for our planet. May God forgive us and protect us.# Sadness

Victor_Milson: The President addressed a joint session of Congress yesterday. He said he wasn't gonna back down on the blockade. I don't know which was scarier, the speech or the Congress cheering it. He evoked Lincoln. Whenever a president is gonna get us into serious trouble, they always use Lincoln. I honestly don't know if we're gonna be at war or not - it's terrifying to hope that the Russians are less crazy than we are, when they are clearly crazy. Right now, I think you're in a safer place than we are. I just hope that there is an Earth to return to.# Trust,Joy,Sadness

The_Young_Man: You've been talking all night to a gambler and a thief. I put the word 'thief' second, notice? All my life I've been a gambler. No, don't go listen to me. I think you should hear what sort of a mudpie you've dipped your ladylike fingers into. I was born in Ireland where my father owned a racing stable. At the age of 6 I was saving pennies to back horses for the local bookmaker. Then when I came to England and school, I stopped backing horses and taught the other kids how to play poker. I used to win. At Oxford I got in with the racing set again, and I lost a packet, more than I could ask my father for, so I was sent down. My old man put me into his business in Dublin, providing I promised never to gamble again. So for five years I neither touched a card nor made a bet. I thought I'd got the devil out of my system. As a reward, my father sent me to France to stay with my uncle in Paris. He had a business there. One afternoon we all went to Longshore. They didn't realize that to me, gambling was a disease, a disease which had lain dormant like a cancer for five long years. I knew nothing about form, but luck was with me. That day and the next and the next after, I won a packet. But I didn't really find what was to give me complete and utter satisfaction until I walked through the glass doors of the casino. The sight of the green baize, the scented atmosphere of the room made me drunk, reeling drunk. I was mad to gamble. I can remember my fingers twitching as I picked up the plaques from the cashier's desk and sat down like a drunken man and played. For five nights in succession I won. Some of them advised me to quit, but it was like asking a drug addict to give up dope. I couldn't quit. On the sixth night I had my return ticket into Paris, that was all. I found that my uncle had gone to London and my aunt had gone with him, so I was alone in my apartment without a sou in my pocket. But luck was with me this time. A few weeks before, my aunt had asked me to get something from the safe. And I knew where she kept the key, so I opened it borrowed a pair of diamond earrings.# Joy,Sadness

Prime_Minister_Alastair_Davies: Mr. President. Handing over the pilot may have stopped some of the bleeding for a bit, but this morning's incident means that votes for this treaty are going to be very hard to obtain.# Anger,Sadness

Jack_Bauer: With all due respect Mr. President, it was YOUR State Department that labeled me a terrorist and made me a wanted man. A man who was never even offered an opportunity to tell his side of the story, which by the way sir, I felt I had EARNED. So no, sir. I did not feel comfortable going to TALK to you people.

Mark_Boudreau: I thought that the burden of specifics would distract you from the goal at hand.# Trust,Joy,Sadness
President_James_Heller: So you didn't think that you could trust me with the truth, that if I knew that we had killed civilians somehow I wouldn't lobby as hard as you thought.# Anger,Disgust,Sadness
Mark_Boudreau: I was protecting you. That's why you hired me. "No military action is purely surgical. And when the fight begins, collateral damage is always a factor, but our U.S. drone program lets us hit our enemies with the fewest civilian casualties." Those are your words, Mr. President. That's what you believe. And until I hear otherwise, I'm going to do everything I can to further that policy.# Sadness
President_James_Heller: You want me to put you back in the field?# Sadness

Jack_Bauer: I've got a guy on the ground. He'll be covering you. But it's not a guarantee. Look, this is a long shot. There is a good chance that we will both end up dead. If you don't want to do this, I can't force you. It's a lot to ask.# Anger,Surprise

Fuck the Upper East Side wives with their HermËs scarves and their fifty-dollar Balducci artichokes. Overfed faces getting pulled and lifted and stretched, all taut and shiny. You're not fooling anybody, sweetheart! Fuck the uptown brothers. They never pass the ball, they don't want to play defense, they take five steps on every lay-up to the hoop. And then they want to turn around and blame everything on the white man. Slavery ended one hundred and thirty seven years ago. Move the fuck on! Fuck the corrupt cops with their anus-violating plungers and their 41 shots, standing behind a blue wall of silence. You betray our trust! Fuck the priests who put their hands down some innocent child's pants. Fuck the church that protects them, delivering us into evil. And while you're at it, fuck J.C.! He got off easy!

James_Brogan: We'll drive. Keep driving. Head out to the middle of nowhere, take that road as far as it takes us. You've never been west of Philly, have ya? This is a beautiful country, Monty, it's beautiful out there, like a different world. Mountains, hills, cows, farms, and white churches. I drove out west with your mother one time, before you was born. Brooklyn to the Pacific in three days. Just enough money for gas, sandwiches, and coffee, but we made it. Every man, woman, and child alive should see the desert one time before they die. Nothin' at all for miles around. Nothin' but sand and rocks and cactus and blue sky. Not a soul in sight. No sirens. No car alarms. Nobody honkin' atcha. No madmen cursin' or pissin' in the streets. You find the silence out there, you find the peace. You can find God. So we drive west, keep driving till we find a nice little town. These towns out in the desert, you know why they got there? People wanted to get way from somewhere else. The desert's for startin' over. Find a bar and I'll buy us drinks. I haven't had a drink in two years, but I'll have one with you, one last whisky with my boy. Take our time with it, taste the barley, let it linger. And then I'll go. I'll tell you don't ever write me, don't ever visit, I'll tell you I believe in God's kingdom and I'll see you and your mother again, but not in this lifetime. You'll get a job somewhere, a job that pays cash, a boss who doesn't ask questions, and you make a new life and you never come back. Monty, people like you, it's a gift, you'll make friends wherever you go. You're going to work hard, you're going to keep your head down and your mouth shut. You're going to make yourself a new home out there. You're a New Yorker, that won't ever change. You got New York in your bones. Spend the rest of your life out west but you're still a New Yorker. You'll miss your friends, you'll miss your dog, but you're strong. You got your mother's backbone in you, you're strong like she was. You find the right people, and you get yourself papers, a driver's license. You forget your old life, you can't come back, you can't call, you can't write. You never look back. You make a new life for yourself and you live it, you hear me? You live your live the way it should have been. But maybe, this is dangerous, but maybe after a few years you send word to Naturelle. You get yourself a new family and you raise them right, you hear me? Give them a good life, Monty. Give them what they need. You have a son, maybe you name him James, it's a good strong name, and maybe one day years from now years after I'm dead and gone reunited with your dear ma, you gather your whole family around and tell them the truth, who you are, where you come from, you tell them the whole story. Then you ask them if they know how lucky there are to be there. It all came so close to never happening. This life came so close to never happening. # Anger,Fear,Disgust,Sadness

Narrator: Twenty-six men chosen for their courage and ability formed the Arizona Rangers. Fame and public acclaim was not their objective. This is perhaps why the story of these 26 men has not been told until now. This was the Arizona Territory at the turn of the century - a sparsely settled, raw frontier. Terrified by bands of desperados who operated in open defiance of local peace officers. #None

Ranger_Clint_Travis: I had a little spread near Grainger and I went broke. I need a job.# Fear,Sadness
Capt._Tom_Rynning: You can find an easier one - being a ranger isn't all it's cracked up to be. Sometimes you're in the saddle for 48 hours, no sleep, bad food; picked on by unhappy citizens and shot at by outlaws. You furnish your own horse, arms and equipment. The enlistement is for four years and the pay is 50 dollars a month.# Sadness
Ranger_Clint_Travis: Inspite of that recommendation, I'll take it. My name's Clint Travis.# Anger,Disgust,Sadness

Ranger_Clint_Travis: But the thought of killing a man # Fear,Sadness
Capt._Tom_Rynning: You don't always have to. If a man's mounted, smash an elbow; if he's on a foot a bullet in the shoulder will knock him down and you can disarm him but don't ever fight with your fists - you could cripple your gun hand. Then every two-bit gunslinger would shoot at you and you wouldn't have a chance.# Fear,Sadness

Cornell: If that will make you happy, I will stop drinking. And then I would tell myself tonight I will not get wasted. And then something would happen. Or nothing would happen. And I'd get that feeling and you all know what that feeling is; when your skin is screaming and your hands are shaking and your stomach feels like it wants to jump through your throat. And you know that if anyone had a clue how wrong it felt to be sober, they wouldn't dream of asking you to stay that way. They would say oh geez, I didn't know. It's okay for you. Do that mound of cocaine. Have a drink. Have 20 drinks. Whatever you need to do to feel like a normal human being, you do it. And boy I did it. I drank and I snorted. I drank and snorted. I drank and snorted. And I did this day after day, day after day, night after night. I didn't care about the consequences because I knew they couldn't be half as bad as not using. And then one night something happened. I woke up. I woke up on a sidewalk and I had no idea where I was. I couldn't have told you what city I was in. And my head was pounding and I looked down and my shirt is covered in blood. And as I'm lying there wondering what happens next and I heard a voice. And it said man, this is not a way to live. This is a way to die.#None

Selena: It started as rioting. But right from the beginning you knew this was different. Because it was happening in small villages, market towns. And then it wasn't on the TV any more. It was in the street outside. It was coming in through your windows. It was a virus. An infection. You didn't need a doctor to tell you that. It was the blood. It was something in the blood. By the time they tried to evacuate the cities it was already too late. Army blockades were overrun. And that's when the exodus started.
